# SimOps
SimOps - A virtual airline management and operations tool

## Welcome to SimOps

SimOps is a set of tools that allow you to manage a virtual airline for use with common desktop flight simulators like FS2004, FSX, P3D, MSFS 2020, and XP11. It can only be used by those simulators that are supported by [FSUIPC](http://www.fsuipc.com/) and [XUIPC](https://www.schiratti.com/xpuipc.html).

Anyone can install and host an instance of SimOps and start a virtual airline. Requirements for self-hosting will be documented in an installation guide, to be made available at a future date.
