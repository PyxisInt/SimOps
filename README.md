# SimOps
SimOps - A virtual airline management and operations tool

## Welcome to SimOps

SimOps is a set of tools that allow you to manage a virtual airline for use with common desktop flight simulators like FS2004, FSX, P3D, MSFS 2020, and XP11. It can only be used by those simulators that are supported by [FSUIPC](http://www.fsuipc.com/) and [XUIPC](https://www.schiratti.com/xpuipc.html).

Anyone can install and host an instance of SimOps and start a virtual airline. Requirements for self-hosting will be documented in an installation guide, to be made available at a future date.

## Components

* [SimOpsService](https://github.com/PyxisInt/SimOpsService) - The primary backend for SimOps
* [SimOpsUI](https://github.com/PyxisInt/SimOpsUI) - The desktop client for Windows 10/11
* [SimOpsWeb](https://github.com/PyxisInt/SimOpsWeb) - The web-based client
* [SimCARS](https://github.com/PyxisInt/SimCARS) - The Windows 10/11 based ACARS client

## How to use

The best way to use SimOps for your virtual airline needs is to install all the components in your own infrastructure. This can be a cloud based infrastructure or a on-premise infrastructure. For details on how to install and any pre-requisites, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/install.md)
